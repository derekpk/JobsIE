In this repo there is a .Net VB web application developed in MS Visual Studio on Windows 7.

The application is best described in the follwing document.
JobsIE/Documents/DerekKeogh_Internet System Development Project.doc

It contains a user guide and the documented normanlization process of the database used to store the details of the users.

To run it yourself you will need to have Visual Studio 2010 installed on a Windos 7 box, although Visual Studion ships with a
development IIS server you'd be better off having IIS 6.1 install and configuared so you can build and test a deployment
to a running web srever. SQLExpress is used as the database backend.
